# Customer Analytics & Churn Prediction Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project analyzes customer behavior, sales performance, support efficiency, and churn patterns using real-world styled datasets.  
The goal is to generate actionable business insights and predict customer churn.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives
- Understand revenue trends and top-performing regions
- Analyze customer purchasing behavior
- Evaluate customer support efficiency
- Identify churn drivers and predict churn
- Present insights through visualizations

## 📁 Datasets used

This project uses three datasets:

1. **Retail Transactions Dataset**
   - File size is very large, so the raw dataset is **not uploaded to GitHub**
   - Used for revenue and sales analysis
   - Source: Kaggle (Online Retail Dataset)
   - Cleaned and processed within the notebooks
    [Retail Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/mashlyn/onlineretail-ii-simple-eda)  
   > **Note:** This file is too large to upload to GitHub. Please download and place it in `notebooks/data/` to run the notebooks.

2. **Customer Support Tickets Dataset**
   - Used for ticket volume, resolution time, and customer satisfaction analysis
     Small CSV uploaded in `notebooks/data/`  

3. **Telecom Customer Churn Dataset**
   - Used for churn prediction and customer behavior analysis
     Small CSV uploaded in `notebooks/data/`

⚠️ Note: Due to size limitations, large raw datasets are excluded. All analysis steps are reproducible using the provided notebooks.
